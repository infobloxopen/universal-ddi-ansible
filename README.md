# Universal DDI Collection for Ansible

This repo hosts the `infoblox.universal_ddi` Ansible Collection. 

The collection provides modules to automate your Universal DDI (DHCP, DNS and IPAM) and Infoblox Cloud objects hosted in the Infoblox Portal.

> **Note:** This collection replaces the legacy [B1DDI collection](https://github.com/infobloxopen/bloxone-ansible). The Universal DDI collection is a complete rewrite of the B1DDI collection and provides a more robust and feature-rich set of modules to manage Infoblox Universal DDI resources.

### Migration from Legacy Modules

We recommend migrating from the legacy B1DDI Collection since they will be deprecated in the near future. Please expect a few breaking changes while migrating from legacy modules to the new collection modules. A migration guide will be published soon to help you with the migration process.

### Plugin Documentation 

The complete information regarding the collection and the supported modules can be found in the [documentation](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infoblox/universal_ddi/docs/).

## Installation

**Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy**

To install the Universal DDI Collection, you can use the `ansible-galaxy` command line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install infoblox.universal_ddi
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: infoblox.universal_ddi
```

You can also clone the git repository and use the collection directly:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ansible_collections/infoblox/universal_ddi
git clone https://github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-ansible.git ~/ansible_collections/infoblox/universal_ddi
```

## Requirements

- Required Ansible version: 2.15 or later
- Required Python version: 3.9 or later

The collection also requires the following Python Libraries to be installed:

- requests >= 2.32.0
- [universal-ddi-python-client](https://pypi.org/project/universal-ddi-python-client/) >= 0.1.0

### Installing required libraries and SDK

Installing collection does not install any required third party Python libraries or SDKs. The user needs to install the required Python libraries using following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are working on developing and/or testing Infoblox Universal DDI collection, you may want to install additional requirements using following command:

```bash
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Portal URL

The default URL for the Cloud Services Portal is `https://csp.infoblox.com`. If you need to change this, you can pass the `portal_url` as a part of `modules_defaults` in the playbook. For example:

```yaml
module_defaults:
  group/infoblox.universal_ddi.all:
    portal_url: "{{portal_url_value}}"
```

You can also set the URL using the environment variable `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL` or `BLOXONE_CSP_URL`.

> **Note:** `BLOXONE_CSP_URL` is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. It is recommended to use `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL` instead.


### Authorization

An API key is required to access Infoblox API. You can obtain an API key by following the instructions in the guide for [Configuring User API Keys](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/BloxOneCloud/35430405/Configuring+User+API+Keys).

To use an API key with Infoblox API, you can pass the `portal_key` as a part of `modules_defaults` in the playbook . For example:

```yaml
module_defaults:
  group/infoblox.universal.all:
    portal_key: "{{portal_key_value}}"
```

Alternatively, You can also set the API key using the environment variable `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY` or `BLOXONE_API_KEY` .

> **Note:** `BLOXONE_API_KEY` is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. It is recommended to use `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY` instead.

> **Note:** The API key is a secret and should be handled securely. Hardcoding the API key in your code is not recommended.

## Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the `infoblox.universal_ddi` collection to create a DNS Auth Zone inside a View.

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  module_defaults:
    group/infoblox.universal_ddi.all:
      portal_url: "{{portal_url_value}}"
      portal_key: "{{portal_key_value}}"
  tasks:
    - name: Create a DNS View
      infoblox.universal_ddi.dns_view:
        name: "example_view"
        state: present
      register: dns_view

    - name: Create a new DNS Auth Zone
      infoblox.universal_ddi.dns_auth_zone:
        fqdn: "example.com"
        primary_type: "cloud"
        view: "{{ dns_view.id }}"
        state: present
```

Demo usage for each module can be found in the `Examples` section of the module documentation.
